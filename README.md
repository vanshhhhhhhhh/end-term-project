End Term Project of Vansh Srivastava(24BCS10567)
  My projecrt NimbusNow makes use of 3 APIs - (OpenWeather Weather, OpenWeather Forecast and OpenWeather AirPollution APIS).
  Using the APIs , it fetches the current weather forecast, the next 5 days weather forecast and the overall Air Quality Index of the entered city.
  it displays detailed information regarding the air quality index including the levels of PM2.5,PM10,N02,03,C03 etc. in the air.
  Taken reference and some help on how to integrate apis from YouTube.
